# ReactTutorial
A simple project I completed to learn the basics of JavaScript and React. The finished product is a tic-tac-toe game that allows the user to see and change past moves.

## Running.
In the future, I'd like to find a way to turn the build into a web app, but for now, you can run the game by doing the following:
- `cd` into the `tutorial` directory.
- Run `npm start`.
